### Introduction

ediarum is a package of three different combinable software solutions and technologies: [eXistdb](http://www.exist-db.org), [Oxygen XML Author](http://oxygenxml.com/xml_author.html) and [ConTeXt](http://wiki.contextgarden.net). The package and multiple extensions - not the software himself - are developed by [TELOTA](http://www.bbaw.de/telota) - an iniatitve for the "Digital Humanities" at the [Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities](http://www.bbaw.de). Together these options create a digital work environment in which manuscripts and other TEI-XML documents can easily be transcribed and edited. Note that ediarum must always be customized for the individual project. 

### Oxygen XML framework

The central software component is Oxygen XML Author. TELOTA developed for each project an "Oxygen XML framework" (also known as "documenttype association"). Oxygen XML offers out-of-the-box various Java operations that enable users to mark up an XML document by simply clicking a button. With ediarum.jar we have extended these operations by adding a few more - especially operations for working with a central index xml file in an database.

See Wiki for a [documentation of all Java operations](JAVA_OPERATIONS_EN.md
) - also available in [german](JAVA_OPERATIONS_DE.md)
